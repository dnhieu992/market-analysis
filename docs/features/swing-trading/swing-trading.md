## Description

Swing Trading is a full-stack feature (web page + API + worker) that runs the
**UTBot trend stop-and-reverse strategy on candle close** — the flow validated in
`claude-backtest/`. It trades a **hardcoded list of robust, backtested pairs**
(`swing-pairs.ts`: ETH 4h kv2, BTC 1d kv2, BNB 4h kv4, SOL 1d kv2 — curve-fit
rejects like XRP/SUI/LINK/DOGE/SHIB/ADA excluded), each with its own per-pair
timeframe + keyValue and an **independent always-in-market position book** that
flips direction whenever a closed candle confirms a UTBot trend change. It mirrors
the Day Trading feature and is built to graduate from PAPER simulation to **live
Bitget execution** via a localized executor seam.

## Main Flow

1. **Worker scan** (`SwingTradingService`, cron `0 1 */4 * * *` UTC — just after each H4 close):
   - Load global risk knobs from `SwingTradingSettings` (atrPeriod, riskPerTrade, leverage, mode) —
     these are shared across all pairs. `symbol`/`timeframe`/`keyValue` on the settings row are no
     longer used by the engine (legacy single-coin fields).
   - **Loop over `SWING_PAIRS`** (`swing-pairs.ts`): each pair carries its own `symbol`, `timeframe`
     and per-coin `keyValue` (the backtest optimum — e.g. BNB 4h needs kv=4, not the global default).
     Each pair runs `scanPair` independently; a failure on one pair is logged and does not abort the others.
   - Per pair: fetch candles from Bitget (`SwingBitgetService`), **drop the in-progress last candle**.
   - Evaluate UTBot (`UtBotStrategyService`): `nLoss = keyValue × ATR(atrPeriod)`, `trend = close > stop ? bull : bear`.
   - Compare trend to the open position (which may be several legs — a BASE + pullback adds):
     - **no position** → open a BASE leg in the trend direction.
     - **position == trend** → keep; trail the UTBot stop on every leg, run the **partial
       take-profit / breakeven** rule (see below), then maybe fire a **pullback scale-in**.
     - **position != trend** → **flip**: close **ALL** legs at the candle close (gross P&L each), open the reverse BASE leg.
   - **Partial take-profit + breakeven** (every leg): once price has run **+5%** (`PARTIAL_TP_PCT`)
     from the leg's entry, close **half** the leg (`PARTIAL_FRACTION`), bank the realized P&L
     (`realizedPnlUsd`), and ratchet the stop to **breakeven (entry)** (`breakEvenMoved`/`partialClosed`).
     The remaining half rides the UTBot trail (stop floored at entry) and exits on the trend flip, or at
     breakeven if a candle closes back through entry before the UTBot line has trailed past it. A
     breakeven stop-out of the BASE leg leaves the book flat for that candle; the next aligned close
     re-opens a fresh BASE (re-entry on trend continuation). The banked half is added to `pnlUsd` at full close.
   - **Pullback add-on** (`pullback-addon.ts`, gated to effective `keyValue === 4`): while aligned
     with the trend, when the close returns within **1%** of the UTBot line, open one more leg in the
     trend direction (`legKind: 'ADD'`). Re-arm only after price moves **>1%** away from the line and
     returns; **max 3 adds** per trend leg. The re-arm flag (`pullbackArmed`) lives on the BASE leg.
     Backtest finding: the rule amplifies clean (kv=4) trends but bleeds on chop (kv=2/3), hence the gate
     (`claude-backtest/runs/2026-06-15-pullback-addon-rule.md`).
2. **Execution** (`SwingExecutorService`): PAPER persists the position to `swing_trading_signals`;
   LIVE (future) places the real Bitget order at the same seam. Sizing: `notional = riskPerTrade × leverage`, `qty = notional / entryPrice`.
3. **API** (`/swing-trading/*`): list signals, stats (wins/losses/winRate/pnl), live price, per-signal note, settings GET/PUT.
4. **Web** (`/swing-trading`): stats header, status filter (Tất cả / Đang mở / Đã đóng), signal cards
   (entry, UTBot flip level, notional, live unrealized P&L + distance-to-flip), markdown note, settings panel.

## Edge Cases

- **Hardcoded pairs**: the traded list lives in `swing-pairs.ts` (worker) and is mirrored in
  `TRACKED_PAIRS` in `swing-trading-feed.tsx` (web settings display). Keep the two in sync. Each pair's
  `keyValue` is used as-is (per-coin optimum) and bypasses `settings.keyValue`, since one global value
  can't be right for every coin (BNB kv=4 vs ETH kv=2). The list reflects a single year/regime —
  re-run `claude-backtest/` and update both files periodically.
- **Per-pair position books**: each pair's legs are isolated by `symbol` in the repository, so flips /
  adds on one coin never touch another. Multiple coins can hold open positions simultaneously.
- **Pullback add-on gate**: scale-in legs only fire when the effective `keyValue === 4`
  (`PULLBACK_KEYVALUE`). At any other kv the add-on is inert — the flow is the plain stop-and-reverse.
- **Pullback re-arm state**: `pullbackArmed` is tracked only on the BASE leg and reset to `false`
  whenever a fresh BASE opens (first entry or flip), so each trend leg re-arms independently.
- **Multi-leg flip**: a flip closes every ACTIVE leg for the symbol (base + adds), each booked as its
  own realized `pnlUsd`, then opens one fresh BASE leg.
- **In-progress candle**: the scan drops the last candle so it only acts on a confirmed close (`candles.slice(0, -1)`).
- **Idempotent re-run**: a second scan in the same candle sees the position already matching the trend
  → re-syncs the stop and re-evaluates the deterministic add-on rule; it opens no duplicate entry
  because firing an add immediately clears `pullbackArmed`.
- **Insufficient candles** (`< atrPeriod + 3`) → scan logs and returns.
- **Bitget/price failure**: candle fetch returns `[]` (scan skips); live price falls back to last cached value, never throws.
- **No fixed full-TP**: `takeProfit` stored as 0. The only profit target is the +5% partial (half the
  leg); the runner has no fixed TP and exits on the trend flip or the breakeven stop. Win/loss derived
  from realized `pnlUsd` sign (which already includes any banked `realizedPnlUsd`).
- **Partial fires once per leg**: guarded by `partialClosed`; `quantity` is reduced to the remainder so
  live unrealized P&L and the final close use the correct size. The `+5%` is a raw price move from entry
  (not leverage-adjusted). Applies to BASE and ADD legs alike (each vs its own entry).
- **Auto-journal on the note**: each lifecycle event appends one markdown bullet to the signal's `note`
  (Vietnam time): `▶️` vào lệnh (set on create), `🎯` chốt 1/2 + kéo SL về entry, `🟰` đóng nốt hòa vốn,
  `✋` đóng do đảo trend. Rendered on `/swing-trading` in the note block. Appending is best-effort
  (`SwingExecutorService.appendNote` swallows errors). It shares the same field as the manual trader
  note, so a manual save can overwrite earlier auto lines — acceptable trade-off for simplicity.
- **P&L is gross** (fees excluded) to mirror the day-trading monitor; real Bitget fees (~0.05%/side) reduce live results — see `claude-backtest/`.

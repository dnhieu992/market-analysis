## Description

Trade lifecycle + per-trade journal for `/bitget`. Every Bitget USDT-futures trade
is mirrored into a single `bitget_trades` row that the worker moves through its
lifecycle (`status: open → closed`). Each trade carries a timeline of log items
(`bitget_trade_journals`): **manual** notes the trader writes (Claude-formatted,
with chart images) plus **system** items the worker writes automatically when a
trade opens and closes. Items are grouped per trade session by `tradeKey`
(`symbol-holdSide-openedAt(ISO)`), so re-opening the same symbol/side later starts
a fresh timeline.

## Main Flow

1. **Worker reconcile (every 15m + on boot)** — `BitgetHistoryService.sync()`:
   - Reads live open positions (`all-position`). A newly-seen one is inserted as
     `status=open` and gets a system "🟢 Đã mở lệnh" log.
   - Reads closed history (`history-position`). The matching open row is flipped to
     `status=closed` (realized PnL filled) and gets a system "🔴 Đã đóng lệnh" log.
     A trade opened+closed within one interval is inserted closed directly, with
     both an opened and a closed log.
2. **Open positions tab** — live from Bitget every 15s; each row has a 📝 button
   opening the journal drawer (`status: open`, live position attached).
3. **History tab** — reads `bitget_trades` where `status=closed`; each row has a 📝
   button opening the same drawer (`status: closed`).
4. **Drawer** — loads the trade's log timeline (`GET /bitget/journal?tradeKey=`),
   shows system + manual items chronologically. The trader writes a manual note
   (TipTap editor + image upload to R2); on save it is Claude-reformatted
   (`POST /journal/reformat`), images uploaded (`POST /upload/images`), then
   persisted (`POST /bitget/journal`) with a price/PnL snapshot. Manual notes can
   be edited/deleted; system items are read-only.

## Edge Cases

- **No positionId on open positions** — Bitget's open-position endpoint returns no
  id, so `tradeKey` (from `cTime`) is the stable lifecycle key; `positionId` is
  filled only on close.
- **Matching open↔closed** — primary match is by `tradeKey` (same `cTime`); a
  fallback matches an open row for the same symbol+side that is **not currently
  live**, so a live position is never closed by mistake. Only one open position per
  symbol+side exists on Bitget at a time.
- **Idempotent close** — once a trade has a `positionId`, re-syncing skips it, so
  the "closed" log is written exactly once.
- **Fast trades** (opened+closed between polls) still get both an opened and a
  closed log.
- **System items are read-only** — the API rejects edit/delete of `kind=system`.
- **Claude reformat fails** — the raw manual note is saved verbatim with a warning.
- **Legacy closed trades** (migrated from the old table) get a `legacy-<positionId>`
  tradeKey; they have no journal, and their 📝 simply shows an empty timeline.
